3,@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
4,"@USAirways your service at PHL is abysmal. An hour on the runway waiting for a gate, no information anywhere, missed my connection abysmal!"

6,@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.
7,@USAirways been on hold for 39 minutes and counting for a month old change fee refund request for a funeral.  This is pathetic.
8,"@USAirways OK we are on DAY 11 trying to  book a flight for 4.  Ur system STILL says ""due to weather‚Ä¶.call back Late Flightr""  #outofbusiness ?"
9,@VirginAmerica I didn't today... Must mean I need to take another trip!

18,. @USAirways It's been Cancelled Flighted. Your SM response is slow.
19,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
20,@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
21,@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
22,@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.
23,@JetBlue I guess you weren't able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow
24,@united lol too little too Late Flight
25,"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."

52,@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.

57,"@VirginAmerica a lot of ""apologies"" being thrown out to customers from what I can see.Very sad. Thanks for nothing. Worst airline ever."

63,"@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start."
64,@SouthwestAir very poor customer service thru out each of my cxl flightsüòî I should've flew @Delta
65,@united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.
66,@USAirways I'm glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available.
67,@USAirways shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout
68,"@united I was abused , threatened and forced to travel in a lower cabine (last seat) in yesterday's flight from Houston to Sao Paulo"
69,@JetBlue woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!!

129,@USAirways Ann Marie at LGA is the best ticket agent ever! #excellentcustomerservice
130,"@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed."

144,@SouthwestAir is there a way to know who checked my bag on the curb? She was awesome!!! And want to be sure she gets a high five!

152,@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
153,"@SouthwestAir Again, please accept my apologies for my lame, childish tweet. You didn't deserve that, &amp; I remain a LOYAL SW customer!"
154,@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
155,@JetBlue Tell me at what point will u realize u can't fly into DCA tonight- u Cancelled Flightled the 1pm when will u Cancelled Flight the 5:26
156,@USAirways Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it?

158,"@AmericanAir already did- reply was ""sorry. we believe this to be fair."" as a journalist writing an article on my trip i will include this"
159,@JetBlue I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.
160,@AmericanAir wish you had a better mobile app.  You should look at the app from @united as it is much more seemless to check in
161,@AmericanAir so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what?
162,@USAirways found great prices thru US Air for honeymoon. Website wont work and been on hold for more than a hour now after being told 10 min

169,@USAirways final count 3 hours 24 minutes on hold to be told I need to log in to U.S. Airways website and there was nothing else to be done

171,@SouthwestAir 2nd leg of trip Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold 1.5 hrs. Will we lose our $ if we don't speak to someone before first flight leaves?
172,@JetBlue yes! Announced we will take off. You're on it! Thank you!
173,@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
174,@USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again
175,"@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants."

192,@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well
193,@SouthwestAir delay is understandable but look at the time of the the flight and boarding time. Weird!
194,@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
195,@USAirways Your app and website are trash AF.

220,@VirginAmerica thanks for gate checking my baggage on your full flight dfw-lax 883 and giving me early boarding too #sweet
221,@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
222,@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
223,@SouthwestAir yeah they told me it would be on the next flight. I drove down and it wasnt. I just drove down for a second time and they were

244,@USAirways how much is it to check golf clubs on a flight. They might be oversized
245,@SouthwestAir you guys need better communication to your customers. This is rude and unprofessional.
246,@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.

275,@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
276,@JetBlue CEO battles to please Wall St and flyers - from @NZherald http://t.co/Q4Amiw7FSw
277,@AmericanAir the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.
278,"@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful."
279,@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back

281,@SouthwestAir Flight to Nashville was Cancelled Flightled. How do we another flight? I've been trying to call &amp; cannot get a human
282,@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fianc√©e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
283,"@USAirways should, but didn‚Äôt."
284,@SouthwestAir might be the worst airline ever
285,@SouthwestAir  thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow.
286,"@SouthwestAir Problem is, I wasn't issued a position until today at the gate. And no option to upgrade. Not good when you're 6'4."
287,@AmericanAir Flight 2559 it's been delayed every hour since 8:55 am.
288,@SouthwestAir done messed up now!!! I have planned a trip to #CostaRica for pennies!!! #VacaTime ‚úàÔ∏èüí∫

290,@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
291,"@AmericanAir Flight 2954, Dallas to Grand Junction #AmazingFlightCrew"
292,@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
293,"@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection"

303,@SouthwestAir: why no charging station in SAN?
304,@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
305,@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
306,@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
307,@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
308,"@AmericanAir LGA already by the time we pulled from the flight. QQBMUG. feel free to look up how many flights we've been ""reticketed"" on."
309,@SouthwestAir I thought you guys were the best airline...I've been on hold for an hour!
310,@AmericanAir could you check if there is SWU (typo in last post) space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
311,@JetBlue check DM please :)

314,@USAirways My bags were supposed to be delivered to NYC last night (missing since Thurs) but are not here. Can someone call me?
315,"@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, ""not yet located""?"
316,@USAirways I'm supposed to fly through Dallas. Can you help me get a new itinerary?
317,"@SouthwestAir really enjoying sitting at BWI with the door wide open and the a/c on as they fix a ""baggage error"" #sarcasm"

320,@AmericanAir so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys
321,@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
322,@SouthwestAir How to I rebook on-line when it keeps telling me that it's a reserv number for a past date (this morning)? Holding for 2hrs.
323,@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
324,@southwestair Flight 4146 Phi to Den was staffed by a great crew. #freecomedyshow #newlifetimecustomer

338,@AmericanAir hey! Tried calling customer service and was told there's a 2 hour wait. This has been for the past 4 hours. Thanks! You suck!
339,@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?

348,@USAirways Thank you for your help today.  I have been a loyal US airways customer and i appreciate your responding to my tweets.
349,@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
350,@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
351,@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
352,@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
353,@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
354,@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
355,"@united Brian at SFO customer service deserves a raise, gave me extra meal voucher and a good joke to cheer me up after flight delay. #FTW"
356,"@SouthwestAir there... from my first interaction with your people this morning, after bad weather, sorry but I wont be flying with you again"
357,@USAirways Commitment to excellence is 2b praised. Can get you to the wrong city 2 days Late Flight or the right one 3 days Late Flight. #customerservice
358,@SouthwestAir can i have my bags back   ding!!
359,@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
360,@USAirways me too!
361,@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
362,@VirginAmerica got it. All set - Thanks!
363,@SouthwestAir can you answer the phone so I can change my flight plans. Srsly.
364,@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
365,@SouthwestAir I was just sitting here talking at a tech conference about how awesome you guys are and this rolled across. Luv you guys! #LOL
366,"@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight."

374,"@SouthwestAir Thanks so much. Appreciate your kindness in adjusting our reservation. Even during snowstorms, I still prefer Southwest. üëç"
375,@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
376,@AmericanAir #last #flight #ever on #AA. You botched this weather delay to the point of absurdity. I'd pay more to fly @Delta
377,@united I'm not sure why I expected anyone to be here http://t.co/bnFlHPXtmw
378,@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
379,@AmericanAir Always enjoy my time. Now on the plane to DFW!
380,"@AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 ""Plane not ready"". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed"
381,@jetblue we never received that $15 credit for inoperable tv's on our SFO &gt; JFK flight 2 weeks ago. never got an email...
382,@USAirways I have a flight in Saturday from MCI to CLT and there's heavy snow predicted in MCI. When will u allow for changes?

384,@JetBlue the departure time keeps getting Late Flightr.  I'll be lucky if I'm home by 3am
385,@AmericanAir no apologies required. I made it home safe thanks to you! Kudos to AA!
386,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
387,@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
388,@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
389,@USAirways yesterday we were delayed for SIX hours w/lil to NO explanation we paid LOTS of $$ 2 fly w/u &amp; this is how u treat ur customers?
390,"@USAirways Do your flight schedules to - from Quintana Roo, Mexico reflect their newly adopted time zone change to EST?"
391,"@USAirways on the DL, send Ethan some new pants and some ""white revive"" laundry tabs. He's a great guy, good crew, he's just, err, single."
392,@united Any news about the departure of the flight UA51?
393,Thanks @JetBlue. Next up we will see how the slog from JFK to the city goes!
394,@SouthwestAir I would like to ask that his bags be picked up at PIT &amp; taken to his hotel by the airport. Will someone contact me
395,"@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that ""really there are 3 not 4 seats"""

405,@USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite
406,@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
407,@SouthwestAir Awwweesssooomee!

434,@SouthwestAir I'm sorry for straying and going with @AmericanAir I've learned my lesson. These attendants need some SW happiness!

467,"@united is pri boarding for ""Active Military"" or only ""In Uniform?"" 90% can't travel in uniform for OPSEC reason, even on official travel"
468,@AmericanAir why are you still selling tickets when you haven't rebooked people to arrive at their destinations on time?
469,@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
470,@united I filled out the form but I haven‚Äôt received any sort of email confirmation that it‚Äôs been received. Is that normal?
471,@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
472,@USAirways why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection?

475,@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
476,@JetBlue no more than half an hour wait. It's unreal. Finally first bag coming out. SJU needs to work on this
477,"@AmericanAir I'm trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim"
478,@JetBlue should've been on one of your flights instead... @SouthwestAir has now lost our bags to add insult to injury
479,@USAirways @nm4agoodlife      5 hours on hold and no answer . Guess the synergy of a merger was really planned out

483,@AmericanAir @lpalumbo what weather sun is out
484,@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
485,"@SouthwestAir, got ""duped"" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won't give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful"

824,@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.
825,@JetBlue @pilyoc dont talk about my friend @JetBlue like that. #thefutureisweird
826,@AmericanAir It says on you web site that u fly directly from ORD to DUB. when I try to book it says you do not. Have you stopped ?

848,@USAirways why the hell will you not put us in a hotel when you've stranded us. Your message says mechanical issues not weather. #usairways
849,@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!

1924,‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/XASPqDsqhE‚Äù
1925,@JetBlue @KyleJudah be responsible for replacing it
1926,@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
1927,@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it üòÉ
1928,@JetBlue I would go to Italy to visit my relatives and see the house my dad left when he passed.
1929,@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
1930,@JetBlue You definitely will!
1931,"@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost."
1932,@USAirways so the seat next to me (19B) on flight 1943 to Seattle has a tray table that is falling off... http://t.co/HAJ5lKqjW4
1933,"@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say ""oh well"""
1934,"@SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?"
1935,@AmericanAir Thank you for the quick customer service today. #RefundProcedureNotTooPainful I know that Winter Weather is not your fault.
1936,@AmericanAir just downloaded the app for iPhone.  Notice drink coupon but nothing is displayed?  Getting ready to fly...
1937,"@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt"
1938,"@USAirways well, depending on the policy will make the determination as to which airline is selected to travel."
1939,@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
1940,@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don‚Äôt need this much trouble.
1941,@SouthwestAir Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do?
1942,@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
1943,"@USAirways @GregWallace66 Yea, they will give you 5 cents on the dollar!"
1944,"@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!"
1945,@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
1946,@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
1947,@AmericanAir gate agent Jan L at Phoenix was at least able to get my younger daughter seated near my wife. Thank you!
1948,@SouthwestAir go south everyone
1949,@AmericanAir attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn't the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! http://t.co/5SdlyN9MSS
1950,@USAirways stranded in Philly- #Starving and can't get a meal voucher even though your plane had mechanical issue /  next flight in 10 hrs
1951,@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
1952,@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
1953,"@AmericanAir Yep, was in one of my other camera memory card :D"
1954,"@USAirways guys I need help my reservations, tried calling and I'm told to call Late Flightr. Please help me here."
1955,@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
1956,@SouthwestAir @SMiles1307 over two hours now.  Ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable ESP after a pre flight check that was ok.
1957,@JetBlue really caring??
1958,@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... üòâ what about the impossible connection that started this?
1959,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
1960,@AmericanAir that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure
1961,@SouthwestAir I was on hold for two hours and finally hung up. I was able to do what I needed to without customer service eventually.
1962,@JetBlue please get service started at @triflight and offer good routes lile florida upstate ny vegas etc
1963,@USAirways sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection
1964,@USAirways I don't know I've tried to call for confirmation but calls aren't going thru. Can you let me know?
1965,@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
1966,@AmericanAir Thanks for the response.Tough night for all involved. Our flight got Cancelled Flightled as we started taxiing down the runway.
1967,@JetBlue How can I check that? I do not believe I was given a credit for that automatically. :/
1968,@USAirways I received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included
1969,"@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation"
1970,@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...
1971,"@united @laurasbrown5 What does ""dealing via email"" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices"
1972,@united customers ‚úÖ. Customer service ‚ùå http://t.co/qP6Aw3nLIP
1973,@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
1974,@AmericanAir I was just called abt my flight Cancelled Flightlation- a flight that was Cancelled Flightled at 10:30a Sunday. Two 4:00a calls are not okay.
1975,@SouthwestAir on hold for 45 mins. Anyone hv a connection at SW or at another airline to get from CHI n Columbus to EWR in am?
1976,@VirginAmerica Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly üò•
1977,@AmericanAir served the nastiest food Ive ever seen yesterday.Rubber chicken in slime. The ENTIRE cabin sent their food back.FAs can confirm
1978,"@JetBlue Flight 152 (N559JB) ""Here's Looking at Blue Kid"" departs @MCO enroute to @BostonLogan http://t.co/qeaDA92MW6"

1980,@united the child is two years old
1981,@JetBlue Guess I'll wait another 24 hrs in hopes rate goes down &amp; is more reasonable. Fingers crossed. Cutting it close to my travel dates.
1982,@SouthwestAir @JohnWayneAir Thank you both very much!!
1983,@AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle
1984,"@AmericanAir @USAirways ""but I take meds that make me severely dehydrated"" {sigh}"
1985,@SouthwestAir to start 2xdaily #B737-700 flights from #Columbus OH to #Boston @BostonLogan on 8AUG #avgeek
1986,@USAirways how hard is it to unload bags in order of arrival? 45 mins and counting for flight 699
1987,"‚Äú@SouthwestAir: #IfThe80sNeverStopped, we'd still be rocking out to this chart-topping hit"". What?  The 80's are over?"
1988,@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
1989,@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
1990,@united I knew I should've flew @VirginAmerica lol
1991,"@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer"

1993,@united I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
1994,@SouthwestAir OMG OMG OMG !!! I JUST DID!!
1995,@USAirways I need an actual person in customer relations for a refund. What # can I call? I will dispute this charge on my credit card.
1996,@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA
1997,@SouthwestAir  flying Southwest for the first time to LGA with a layover in Atlanta!
1998,@AmericanAir you've got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I'm hoping it's on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much
1999,@united flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me
2000,@USAirways you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
2001,@AmericanAir I bet they do! I'm sure they have some form of wear and tear on their skin. I hope they will survive the rest of the winter xxx
2002,"@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful"
2003,"@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer."
2004,@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ

2007,@USAirways KUDOS to your phone support and Charlotte gate staff!
2008,@JetBlue would a storage container like this green one be acceptable to check in with luggage? 18Gal totes http://t.co/mJtK2SFuhG
2009,"@united Also, a United phone representative just asked me for my web password. Is that normal?"
2010,@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
2011,@SouthwestAir... I love you. Air travel doesn't get easier.
2012,@SouthwestAir Service rep didn't say I was dumb just had the tone of voice like I should have known about it.
2013,"@USAirways landed at Phoenix, but we had to board a flight quickly to Vegas so no time at the airport. What now?"
2014,@JetBlue tell your employees that!
2015,"@united Okay, thank you both."

2017,"@JetBlue @JayVig YES! Great real-time example. Thanks for being awesome, #JetBlue! #JVMChat"
2018,@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
2019,@united next day
2020,@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online
2021,@SouthwestAir Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2

But if customer service ment anything to you.... you would try. Quoting policy is never effective customer service."
2024,‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/2UaICFJRmS‚Äù no way
2025,@SouthwestAir what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again?
2026,@JetBlue Flight is 100% full.
2027,@JetBlue tickets were confirmed and sent out. find out today that they Cancelled Flightled our tickets months ago and never sent an email #jetblue
2028,@united understanding the situation we waited and it was opened until 10:30pm
2029,"@AmericanAir Hey, AA! There was a mistake made by your CR on my Flight Booking Problems. When I call your reservations #, I keep getting hung up on. Advise."
2030,@united You shouldn't page o'head that it's best to call 1-800# - on hold 26+ mins
2031,@JetBlue well I'm not sure I'm that bold! lol or are you saying you didn't believe me?? :P
2032,@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
2033,@USAirways What is happening? Have been sitting in Philly for hours. Pls take care of Flight 759 to Chicago. At least least us know! #soLate Flight
2034,"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
2035,@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
2036,@AmericanAir tisk tisk. Rude flight attendants yet again. I can't hang my suit up because I didn't buy first class? @Delta when will I learn
2037,@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
2038,@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
2039,"@SouthwestAir Denver to Phoenix, I think we're finally getting ready to take off."
2040,@JetBlue I have an email that says I have to sign on to the travel bank?  How do I that?
2041,@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
2042,@VirginAmerica what is your policy on flying after surgery?
2043,@SouthwestAir i forgot to put my tsa pre number in before I checked in. It is now in my profile but will it be on my boarding pass in the am
2044,@AmericanAir @emrey35 But it says your agents are too busy and to try back Late Flightr???
2045,"@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?"
2046,@USAirways will you please update your website with the most current flight status? And update your customer service phone # on @google thx
2047,@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
2048,@AmericanAir You're right. Someone is up to something...
2049,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
2050,@JetBlue the big board says we aren't leaving until after 8:30 üò©
2051,@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
2052,"@AmericanAir flight from DC to LA, not to mention fix the circuit breaker in our bathrooms because this plane is as old as me..."
2053,"@AmericanAir @USAirways Yes, obviously! It just stinks that 4pm is the one option when she was supposed to fly at 7AM YESTERDAY."
2054,@JetBlue Exciting times ahead! üòÅüéâ
2055,@JetBlue you got yourselves hot ladies flying the air for life #loyal
2056,@united Cool. Thank you.
2057,@USAirways what is with all the Cancelled Flightlations to PBI? We have pax at DCA that have been sent to 4 different lines between AAL and AWE. Help!
2058,@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?
2059,@SouthwestAir 9 hours at this airport and you can't move a bag from one plane to another! #furious
2060,@AmericanAir #AATeam thanks for working in very rigorous weather conditions for all
2061,@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Congratulations!
2062,@united Thank you for your offer! All sorted out :-)
2063,@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
2064,@SouthwestAir - i needed refund on my Cancelled Flightled flights this morning and had been on hold for more than an hour X 3. what to do?
2065,@USAirways Being put back on hold for what has now been an HOUR is completely unacceptable.
2066,@JetBlue and a HUGE thanks to the crew on flight 1348 who flew in to DCA from SJU Monday night in the snow so we could have a plane!!!
2067,@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
2068,@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
2069,"@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail"
2070,"@USAirways @nburnside26  U hate delays, too?  But u have her $$ &amp; are holding her hostage!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL"
2071,@AmericanAir the group of minor children were broken up into groups. Some still in Miami. Delta has much better customer service!
2072,@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
2073,@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow
2074,@united Thanks!  Good to know.
2075,@united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech
2076,@AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
2077,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
2078,@SouthwestAir give me tickets to atlanta! I would do anything!  Anything üòÜ
2079,@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
2080,@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
2081,@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
2082,"@AmericanAir Hi guys, can you tell me what the emergency is for #AA65 diverting to #Heathrow from Zurich-New York? Thanks, John."
2083,@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
2084,@USAirways pretty upset I drove from Philly to MHtT still no info on my bags. What's the deal!
2085,@JetBlue I will. I love flying with you all. Great service.
2086,"@AmericanAir --(pt 2) and the AA reservations phone number has been less than helpful, telling me to change things online when I can't."
2087,"@AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied!"
2088,"But expect no help from -&gt;@SouthwestAir &lt;-.  Our flt was canx at the last minute for ""weather.""  We flew home on weatherless @united."

2090,"@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding."
2091,"@united's first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks."
2092,@AmericanAir I need a flight out tonight. Isn't there anything else?
2093,@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
2094,@USAirways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
2095,"Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9"

2097,"@united speaking of my flight, skateboards are allowed as carry on bagage right? No extra payment needed?"
2098,@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
2099,@USAirways @AmericanAir Flying from Orlando to Philly to Charlotte to Lynchburg. Saw advisory re Philly. Wld like to fly from Orl to Char
2100,@USAirways what an amazing day. Delayed 4 hrs bc frozen h2o on plane Now sitting @ gate on same plane 4 30 mins still waiting! #flight1797
2101,@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
2102,@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
2103,@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
2104,@USAirways waiting for you to figure it out. This is unacceptable.

2110,@SouthwestAir breaking my heart at BWI 9 hrs @business
2111,@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.

2124,@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
2125,@JetBlue Thanks for the $100 credit because of the 4hr delay. I can tell customer service means a lot to YOU #Thankful
2126,"@SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation."

2139,@USAirways @AmericanAir Not providing pilots for your flights: is this a new feature of your merger? #efficencies
2140,@AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel

2410,@AmericanAir @USAirways you can help by now finding my baggage!!  Reply to me ASAP with who I can direct details to.
2411,@USAirways you should get better employees‚úåÔ∏è

2432,@SouthwestAir Hey sourhwest can you send me to Atlanta to see @Imaginedragons ? I will fly southwest forever. U guys are the best airline!
2433,@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information

2448,@SouthwestAir Not your finest moment in Boston right now!
2449,@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.

2486,@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
2487,@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
2488,@USAirways thank you!

2497,"@USAirways the gate agent said ""it's booked in full. Sorry"" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land."
2498,@usairways I just learned that although there is travel policy and they waive the change fee-you will still be charged a $25 reservation fee
2499,@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
2500,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
2501,@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
2502,@VirginAmerica thank you! I absolutely will üòé
2503,@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.

2511,@VirginAmerica You guys charged me $100 to reschedule a flight that was then Cancelled Flighted and are now refusing to refund it. What's the deal?
2512,"@USAirways If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part..."
2513,@JetBlue woof.
2514,@AmericanAir and is there a delay on our connection to pns?

2519,"@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?"
2520,@AmericanAir how are the runways at DFW? Will you be flying Late Flightr today? Thanks.
2521,@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
2522,"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
2523,@AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE!

2525,@AmericanAir My flight through Dallas was Cancelled Flightled and I talked to reservations agent and got a new flight but have not received an email
2526,@SouthwestAir where was the inclement weather? Other flights left DCA today and this plane appeared to be coming from AUS.
2527,@USAirways Our flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; chaos abounds. I am in good humour. Please give me free everything to appease me.
2528,@SouthwestAir injured at check in yesterday. U told me to go to dr. on hold with SWA for over hour trying to talk with someone. suggestions?
2529,"@JetBlue pls find my bag, I need 2 get home! Very frustrating. Hope my bag is somewhere in @NY_NJairports. Leaving the #jfk w/o my luggage."
2530,@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
2531,@AmericanAir is there a probability that flight 1330 from DFW to DTW will be delayed or Cancelled Flighted?
2532,@JetBlue just sat on a plane for 3 hours in Dulles #insane #ijustwanttobeinBoston #thanksDC
2533,last trip on @AmericanAir ... Poor customer service 3 trips in a row! @Delta here I come!

2557,@AmericanAir been on the phone for 47 minutes...said it would be 10...  Any advice?
2558,@JetBlue loves to respond to positive tweets but they ignore problems w/ customers. Just ask NOLA musician @j_beatz247 about that. #shameful
2559,"@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?"

2571,@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
2572,@united that's not an apology. Say it.
2573,@SouthwestAir Bad enough that there is no seat assigned he's  seating at an exit seat and a male flight attendant removes him from there
2574,@USAirways Really a letter that says you will discuss serving drunks more drinks that doesn't help the current situation
2575,.@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now.

2603,"@AmericanAir It's not about weather, it's logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents?"
2604,@JetBlue do you have direct flights to and from Bos to St Lucia or Antigua?
2605,@USAirways instead of tweeting your customers apologizing why don't you pick up your phone

2627,@USAirways New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think? http://t.co/WbhbljJkS7
2628,@AmericanAir thank you. They are processing my refund.
2629,@AmericanAir many trips coming up!  I will see you soon üòÉ
2630,"@AmericanAir Flt Cancelled Flighted, rescheduled to bad time. Tried 800# 3hrs. Website states can't do online=useless website. Help?"
2631,@JetBlue why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional.
2632,@AmericanAir Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn't involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours?
2633,"@USAirways Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I'm still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up"
2634,@VirginAmerica is that #thestarter??üòÅ
2635,Very quick! TY. @united: @auciello I am sorry to hear this. Can you please follow and DM me the details of what transpired? ^JH
2636,@AmericanAir any ways to get through the 50 minute wait to book a flight?
2637,"@united it has now been 16 days since i applied for my compensation?

Y have i had no correspondence"
2638,@JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!!
2639,"Yes, I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways"
2640,@SouthwestAir I don't have a conference number.  I spoke with Courtney in Texas and David before that. they finally fixed mine after an hour
2641,@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
2642,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
2643,@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
2644,@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
2645,@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
2646,@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
2647,@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
2648,".@SouthwestAir I appreciate that, and not to be rude, but it doesn't solve much. You should AT LEAST cover the cost of stolen goods."
2649,@AmericanAir I'm getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support?
2650,@united She üëè won't üëè be üëè at üëè my üëè wedding üëè. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?
2651,@JetBlue you're killing me now. :-) You got me! #smitten #trueblue
2652,@AmericanAir @justynmoro I totally agree.  You get the automatic phone attendent that goes NO WHERE and hangs up.  Lousy service!
2653,@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
2654,"@JetBlue CEO's challenge: appease passengers, Wall Street - The Columbian http://t.co/pG96ys9aSW"
2655,@USAirways baggage drop at phl b/c is incredibly backed up... unacceptable service
2656,@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
2657,@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
2658,"@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles"
2659,@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
2660,@united - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!
2661,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
2662,"@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?"
2663,@SouthwestAir you will extend if I call the day it expires.why can't it just be extended now?#mightmismybrosgraduation
2664,"@JetBlue Gotcha... but ""lessening the delay"" ... that part's not happening, right?"
2665,@VirginAmerica Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)
2666,@SouthwestAir fl 4158 Cancelled Flightled from Dallas to Austin. No one answering 800#.  Need help.
2667,@VirginAmerica is anyone doing anything there today?  Website is useless and no one is answering the phone.
2668,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
2669,@USAirways I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account.
2670,"@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!"
2671,@united My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don't pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines
2672,.@JetBlue 4 min response time. I'm impressed! I'm in. It's official.  :-) #trueblue  JetBlue gets social.
2673,@USAirways Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation.  You all are the best for this.  Could not have done it without you.
2674,@USAirways Fabulous - thank you so much! Looking forward to taking to the skies with you! :)
2675,@JetBlue thank you thank you!  I finally set up the jetblue app!  Yay!
2676,@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
2677,@JetBlue Gnight checked in at POS &amp; supervisor was unaware of policy. That sucked having to guide him to the internet. He was v unfriendly
2678,@VirginAmerica soooo are you guys going to leave the seatbelt light on all flight? You can barely call this turbulence :-)
2679,@AmericanAir just need to know why it wasn't done like it was promised it would yesterday
2680,"‚Äú@united: @ItsAaronChriz Sorry to hear about your flight. Do you need help reFlight Booking Problems?‚Äù

2692,@USAirways ice cream up front! Solid
2693,@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
2694,@USAirways give us no information and an attitude.
2695,"@VirginAmerica Done, but I need the receipt ASAP. Could you please help? #150219-000114"
2696,@JetBlue Need your help. I'm moving to DC &amp; I want to book a one way fare on your website. It won't seem to let me. Am I missing something?
2697,@USAirways shout out to Cathy at the Vegas airport check-in for hooking us up!
2698,@AmericanAir Thanks for the quick response - it's appreciated!

2710,@JetBlue no. Did not catch his name. I am sure Jason will know.
2711,@AmericanAir is there anyone online that can help... the flight leaves in 3 hrs
2712,"@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT."
2713,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.

2717,@USAirways @AmericanAir How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold
2718,"@USAirways got transf. to Dividend Miles...need to change flight.  Grandma just passed, need to change ticket ASAP. Update on wait time?"
2719,@SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag.
2720,@JetBlue This is how you have me feeling.... http://t.co/esUu0hiAjM
2721,@JetBlue @philpete wonder if that's the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly?
2722,"@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU"
2723,@USAirways The fact we did not get notified hindered our ability to look for alternate flights before they were snapped up.
2724,@VirginAmerica save some for 871 tomorrow AM!
2725,@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail

2736,@USAirways already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this.

2861,"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
2862,@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
2863,@SouthwestAir here is my conf #F8NEQM. My flight was delayed for 3 hours while my friend waited for me on her bday. Please follow up.

2877,@united I would never fly United Airlines again!

2881,@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
2882,@SouthwestAir I couldn't fly you today &amp; it made the trip harder + had to pay for my checked bag. #DevotedyYours but for today. :(
2883,"@AmericanAir not only did you rebook me on the wrong day, your phone system says it can't handle the volume and hangs up on me!!!"
2884,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"

2908,@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
2909,@AmericanAir 3127. Just landed in LIT.
2910,"@SouthwestAir used to exclusively fly SW, but Late Flightly, direct flights &amp; cheaper costs have me switched. üòî why...so... few...direct...flights?"
2911,"@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."
2912,"@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase"
2913,@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
2914,@JetBlue glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that's the best answer u have?
2915,@AmericanAir Any way that we could look at other options for today?

2928,@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
2929,@SouthwestAir Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises
2930,@USAirways @AmericanAir Just got off Int. Flight #799. Your Intentionally rude staff made for a horrible 8hr+ flight on an unsuitable plane.
2931,"@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again."
2932,@JetBlue Disappointed we weren't allowed to bring on an aircraft approved carseat on an empty plane. Not cool.
2933,@AmericanAir at 5 am and have no clue if we have a place to stay or not
2934,"@AmericanAir and feel free to email me mikehertz7@gmail.com - don't worry, we're not going anywhere but this damn Tarmac for a bit!"
2935,@JetBlue Awesome! #bestairlineever
2936,@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
2937,@united what do I do if something is missing from my checked baggage?
2938,@JetBlue I love you
2939,@SouthwestAir Hoping you answer the phone today?
2940,@SouthwestAir Thanks for the response. Was able to get my situation resolved. Not a fan of Mother Nature today. :)

2948,@JetBlue Sent my suggestion and comments via the link provided..

2950,@USAirways standing in line with 100 people all looking to do the same
2951,@AmericanAir I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances.
2952,"@USAirways Will the nightmare ever end? Just found out our flight today is delayed due to ""ground handling delays affecting a prior flight."""
2953,"@SouthwestAir been on hold for over an hour.....not cool, you guys."
2954,@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?
2955,@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.
2956,@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
2957,@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!

2981,@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
2982,"@USAirways &amp; there are seats together, they just have fees. Seems if I'm taking a 5am flight the least you can do is wave the $10."
2983,@JetBlue sis and 16 month old nephew are. Last nights flight and this am mega delayed. Now this evening's is starting w delays. Why?

2988,@USAirways cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.
